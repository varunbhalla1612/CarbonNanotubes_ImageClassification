# CarbonNanotubes_ImageClassification
<b>Background:</b>
Carbon nanotubes forest are Carbon nanotubes which form vertically oriented cellular arrays during their growth.

<b>How are CNTs formed?</b>
- Catalyzed Chemical Vapor Deposition (catalyzed chemical vapor deposition of hydrocarbons over a metal catalyst )

- Under Different Process Parameteres
      
      - Catalyst Concentration
      
      - Growth Temperature
      
      - Feed flow Rate
      
      - Carrier Gas Flow etc
      
 - CNTs & some impurities are formed after the process.
 
 
  <b>Problem Statement:</b>
  Determine the best set of process parameters which result in the most effective production of carbon nanotubes
